# 👀 Hi there
I’m Valentina, I work as a product designer but I have other projects that make 0 money but they are fun to do anyways. None of the things I've done are really done but here are some:

## Slay the Dungeon
Slay is a roguelike dungeon crawler game. This is a remade of the classic Pixel Dungeon. Will be release in March 2026, I hope.

## Follow the lights
Is a very basic 3rd person game I made in Unity for college. The purpose of the game was to educate about the history of the town it was based in. It has like 5min of gameplay TBH so is not finished at all! you can check it t your on risk.

## Unlock Medium article extension

This is a Firefox extension that will create a link to the full article. Only available for Firefox because the Chrome store wanted to charge me like 10 bucks for this, and I honestly just made it in 20 mins for myself and published it in case anybody else may find it useful.
