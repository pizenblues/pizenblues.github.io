## Unlock Medium article extension

This is a Firefox extension that will create a link to the full article. Only available for Firefox because the Chrome store wanted to charge me like 10 bucks for this, and I honestly just made it in 20 mins for myself and published it in case anybody else may find it useful. [Extension Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unlock-medium-article/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)
